== DESCRIPTION
Grackle is a lightweight Ruby wrapper around the Twitter REST and Search APIs. It's based on my experience using the 
Twitter API to build http://cheaptweet.com. The main goal of Grackle is to never require a release when the Twitter 
API changes (which it often does) or in the face of a particular Twitter API bug. As such it's somewhat different 
from other Twitter API libraries. It doesn't try to hide the Twitter "methods" under an access layer nor does it 
introduce concrete classes for the various objects returned by Twitter. Instead, calls to the Grackle client map 
directly to Twitter API URLs. The objects returned by API calls are generated as OpenStructs on the fly and make no 
assumptions about the presence or absence of any particular attributes. Taking this approach means that changes to 
URLs used by Twitter, parameters required by those URLs or return values will not require a new release. It 
will potentially require, however, some modifications to your code that uses Grackle. 

Grackle supports both OAuth and HTTP basic authentication.

==USING GRACKLE

Before you do anything else, you'll need to
  require 'grackle'

===Creating a Grackle::Client
====Using Basic Auth
  client = Grackle::Client.new(:auth=>{:type=>:basic,:username=>'your_user',:password=>'yourpass'})

====Using OAuth
  client = Grackle::Client.new(:auth=>{
    :type=>:oauth,
    :consumer_key=>'SOMECONSUMERKEYFROMTWITTER', :consumer_secret=>'SOMECONSUMERTOKENFROMTWITTER',
    :token=>'ACCESSTOKENACQUIREDONUSERSBEHALF', :token_secret=>'SUPERSECRETACCESSTOKENSECRET'
  })
  
====Using No Auth
  client = Grackle::Client.new

See Grackle::Client for more information about valid arguments to the constructor. It's quite configurable. Among other things, 
you can turn on ssl and specify custom headers. The calls below are pretty much as simple as it gets.

===Grackle Method Syntax
Grackle uses a method syntax that corresponds to the Twitter API URLs with a few twists. Where you would have a slash in 
a Twitter URL, that becomes a "." in a chained set of Grackle method calls. Each call in the method chain is used to build 
Twitter URL path until a particular call is encountered which causes the request to be sent. Methods which will cause a 
request to be execute include:
- A method call ending in "?" will cause an HTTP GET to be executed
- A method call ending in "!" will cause an HTTP POST to be executed
- If a valid format such as .json, .xml, .rss or .atom is encounted, a get will be executed with that format
- A format method can also include a ? or ! to determine GET or POST in that format respectively

===GETting Data
The preferred and simplest way of executing a GET is to use the "?" method notation. This will use the default client 
format (usually JSON, but see Formats section below):
  client.users.show? :screen_name=>'some_user' #http://twitter.com/users/show.json?screen_name=some_user

You can force XML format by doing:
  client.users.show.xml? :screen_name=>'some_user' #http://twitter.com/users/show.xml?scren_name=some_user
  
You can force JSON:
  client.users.show.json? :screen_name=>'some_user' #http://twitter.com/users/show.json?screen_name=some_user

Or, since Twitter also allows certain ids/screen_names to be part of their URLs, this works:
  client.users.show.some_user? #http://twitter.com/users/show/some_user.json

If you use an explicit format, you can leave off the "?" like so:
  client.users.show.xml :screen_name=>'some_user' #http://twitter.com/users/show.xml?scren_name=some_user

===POSTing data
To use Twitter API methods that require an HTTP POST, you need to end your method chain with a bang (!)

The preferred way is to use the Client's default format (usually JSON, but see Formats section below):
  client.statuses.update! :status=>'this status is from grackle' #POST to http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json

You can force a format. To update the authenticated user's status using the XML format:
  client.statuses.update.xml! :status=>'this status is from grackle' #POST to http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml

Or, with JSON
  client.statuses.update.json! :status=>'this status is from grackle' #POST to http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json

===Toggling APIs
By default, the Grackle::Client sends all requests to the Twitter REST API. If you want to send requests to the Twitter Search API, just 
set Grackle::Client.api to :search. To toggle back, set it to be :rest. All requests made after setting this 
attribute will go to that API.

If you want to make a specific request to one API and not change the Client's overall api setting beyond that request, you can use the 
bracket syntax like so:
  client[:search].trends.daily? :exclude=>'hashtags'
  client[:rest].users.show? :id=>'hayesdavis'
 
Search and REST requests are all built using the same method chaining and termination conventions.

===Parameter handling
- All parameters are URL encoded as necessary.
- If you use a File object as a parameter it will be POSTed to Twitter in a multipart request.
- If you use a Time object as a parameter, .httpdate will be called on it and that value will be used

===Return Values
Regardless of the format used, Grackle returns an OpenStruct (actually a Grackle::TwitterStruct) of data. The attributes 
available on these structs correspond to the data returned by Twitter.

===Dealing with Errors
If the request to Twitter does not return a status code of 200, then a TwitterError is thrown. This contains the HTTP method used, 
the full request URI, the response status, the response body in text and a response object build by parsing the formatted error 
returned by Twitter. It's a good idea to wrap your API calls with rescue clauses for Grackle::TwitterError.

If there is an unexpected connection error or Twitter returns data in the wrong format (which it can do), you'll still get a TwitterError.

===Formats
Twitter allows you to request data in particular formats. Grackle automatically parses JSON and XML formatted responses 
and returns an OpenStruct. If you specify a format that Grackle doesn't parse for you, you'll receive a string containing 
the raw response body. The Grackle::Client has a default_format you can specify. By default, the default_format is :json. 
If you don't include a named format in your method chain as described above, but use a "?" or "!" then the 
Grackle::Client.default_format is used.
